# Deprecated

⚠️ Since our upgrade to OJS and OMP 3.3.0 the plugin is deprecated. Replacement should use the new OJS/OMP [REST API](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/dev/api).

# publications-zenon-plugin
Plugin for OJS2/OJS3/OMP3 to retrieve mapping between OMP/OJS and [iDAI.bibliography/zenon](https://zenon.dainst.org).

Results: 
* https://publications.dainst.org/journals/plugins/pubIds/zenon/api/index.php?task=mapping 
* https://publications.dainst.org/books/plugins/pubIds/zenon/api/index.php?task=mapping


Each key in _publications_ corresponds to a Zenon ID.
